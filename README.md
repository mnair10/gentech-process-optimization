# Gentech Process Improvement Project

This project focuses on optimizing Gentech's Proposal Creation Process to enhance operational efficiency, reduce cycle times, and improve customer satisfaction. The primary goal is to achieve a minimum of 15% reduction in the overall cycle time for each proposal.

## Company Overview

- **Gentech**: A global market leader offering software, hardware, and integrated business solutions worldwide.
- **Annual Revenue**: $60 Billion
- **Employees**: 150,000 employees
- **Regions**: North America, Asia Pacific, South America, EMEA, and Japan
- **CEO**: Elliot Smith

## Business Problem

Gentech faced a significant revenue decline of 18% in the last two years, primarily attributed to prolonged cycle times in the Proposal Creation Process. This inefficient process is marked by excessive approval steps and redundant tasks, leading to increased operational costs, foregone revenue, and diminished customer satisfaction.

## Objective and Scope

**Objective**: Revamp the proposal process by eliminating inefficiencies and redundant tasks to enhance operational cycle time by 15%.

**Within Scope**:
- Sellers
- BSS Proposal Support Managers
- Product Design Teams
- Pricing Teams
- Brand Managers

**Out of Scope**:
- Effective Conversion of a Proposal

## Operational Metrics

**Cycle Time**: The time taken from identifying a sales opportunity to submitting a proposal to the client. Proposal creation taking longer than 35 days is considered a defect.

## Project Phases

1. **Define (01/11-07/11)**
   - Operational Metric: Cycle Time
   - Baseline: 31.62 Days
   - Target: 26.87 Days

2. **Measure (08/11-14/11)**

3. **Analyze (15/11-21/11)**
   - Expected Benefits
   - Projected Savings

4. **Improve (22/11-28/11)**
   - Hard Benefits: Increase total revenue by at least 18%
   - Soft Benefits: Draw in new bid opportunities and lower operational costs
   - Strategic Benefits: Enhanced market share and competitive advantage

5. **Control (29/11-05/12)**

## Investment and Risks

- **Investment**: $750,000
- **Risks**: Unexpected delays in project implementation

## Key Findings and Recommendations

### Analysis

- Difficulties in identifying the right BSS agent and missing configuration details are major issues causing increased cycle times.
- North America has the highest average cycle time over the past 3 years.
- William from North America has the highest bid size and greater time cycle.

### Improvements

1. Implement a new application with a user-friendly interface and powerful AI capabilities to streamline the ERP submission process.
2. Use 'Poka-Yoke' methodology with mandatory and validation fields alongside an AI program to minimize errors.
3. Integrate Robotic Process Automation (RPA) for document generation to minimize delays.

### Control

- Continue investing in training for Bid Support Specialists.
- Develop clear escalation protocols for any issues.
- Maintain a dedicated team for ongoing process improvement.
- Schedule periodic reviews to assess the effectiveness of new processes and technology.

## Conclusion

- **Projected Savings**: $1.2 Billion
- **Expected Average Cycle Time**: 26.86 days
- **Current Average Cycle Time**: 31.6 days
